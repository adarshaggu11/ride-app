## 📱 **3 Ways to See Your OTP**

### 1. **Toast Notification** (Recommended) ⭐

- A notification appears at the **top-right** of the screen
- Shows: `"Your OTP is: 351548 (Development Mode)"`
- Stays visible for **10 seconds**
- **NEW**: Now includes the actual OTP code!

### 2. **Backend Terminal** 
- Look at your **backend server** terminal
- You'll see: `📱 OTP for 9182280542: 351548`
- The OTP is the **6-digit number** at the end

### 3. **Browser Console** (F12)
- Press `F12` in your browser
- Go to **Console** tab
- Look for: `📱 OTP for 9182280542: 351548`

## 📊 **What I Just Saw in Your Terminal**

From your backend logs:
```
📱 OTP for 9182280542: 351548
POST /api/auth/send-otp 200 18.655 ms - 65
```

This means:
- ✅ Phone number: `9182280542`
- ✅ OTP generated: `351548`
- ✅ API responded successfully (200 status)
- ✅ OTP valid for 5 minutes

---

## 🎯 **Example OTPs You'll See**

The backend generates **random 6-digit codes** each time:
- First attempt: `351548`
- If you click "Resend OTP": New code like `724891`
- Each code is unique and expires in 5 minutes

---

## 🔍 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### "I don't see the notification"
✅ **Solution**: Look at the **blue info box** on the OTP screen that says:
> "💡 Development Mode: Check the notification above for your OTP or look at the backend terminal"

### "Notification disappeared too fast"
✅ **Solution 1**: Check the **backend terminal** - OTP is still there  
✅ **Solution 2**: Click "Resend OTP" after 30 seconds to get a new one

### "OTP verification failed"
✅ **Make sure you're entering the EXACT code from the notification**  
✅ **Don't use 123456** - that's just a placeholder  
✅ **Use the actual generated code** like `351548`

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Keep both windows visible**: 
   - Browser on left
   - VS Code terminal on right
   - You can see OTPs instantly!

2. **Watch the toast**:
   - Green notification = Success
   - Red notification = Error
   - Includes OTP in development mode

3. **Each phone gets a unique OTP**:
   - `9182280542` → One OTP
   - `9876543210` → Different OTP
   - OTPs don't repeat
