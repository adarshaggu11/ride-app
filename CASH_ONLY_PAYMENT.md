## User Experience

### Payment Flow

1. **Book Ride** → User books a ride as usual
2. **Complete Ride** → Driver completes the trip
3. **View Fare** → User sees total fare on app
4. **Pay Cash** → User pays driver directly in cash
5. **Rate Driver** → User can rate the ride experience

### Payment Instructions Shown to Users

**English:**
- "This app only accepts cash payments"
- "Pay your driver directly after the ride is completed"
- "Complete your ride as usual"
- "Check the fare on the app"
- "Pay the driver in cash"

**Telugu:**
- "ఈ యాప్ నగదు చెల్లింపులను మాత్రమే అంగీకరిస్తుంది"
- "రైడ్ పూర్తయిన తర్వాత మీ డ్రైవర్‌కు నేరుగా చెల్లించండి"
- "మామూలుగా మీ రైడ్‌ని పూర్తి చేయండి"
- "యాప్‌లో ఛార్జీని తనిఖీ చేయండి"
- "డ్రైవర్‌కు నగదుగా చెల్లించండి"
