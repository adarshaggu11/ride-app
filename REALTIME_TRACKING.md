# Real-Time Vehicle Tracking with 3D Markers

## Overview

The app now features **real-time vehicle tracking** with professional **3D animated markers** that show nearby bikes, autos, and cars moving on the map based on live location updates.

## Key Features

### 1. **Live Vehicle Tracking Service**
- **File**: `src/services/vehicleTrackingService.ts`
- Tracks 15-20 vehicles in real-time around user's location
- Updates vehicle positions every **2 seconds**
- Realistic movement simulation with speed and bearing
- Vehicle types: Bike, Auto, Car
- Driver information: Name, rating, phone, vehicle number

### 2. **3D Animated Markers**
- **Custom SVG markers** with vehicle type-specific colors:
  - 🏍️ **Bikes**: Blue (#3b82f6)
  - 🛺 **Autos**: Yellow (#FFC107)
  - 🚗 **Cars**: Purple (#8b5cf6)
  
- **Features**:
  - Rotating arrows showing direction of movement
  - Green availability indicator
  - Professional drop shadows
  - Smooth animations (30 frames over 2 seconds)
  - Bearing rotation based on travel direction

### 3. **Vehicle Type Filtering**
On **HomeScreen**, users can filter vehicles by type:
- **All** - Show all nearby vehicles
- **Bikes** - Show only bikes
- **Autos** - Show only autos
- **Cars** - Show only cars

Each filter button shows the live count of available vehicles.

### 4. **Interactive Markers**
Click any vehicle marker to see:
- Driver name
- ⭐ Rating (e.g., 4.5/5.0)
- Vehicle registration number
- ✓ Availability status (Available/Busy)

### 5. **Smart Distance Filtering**
- Shows vehicles within **5km radius** of user location
- Automatically updates as user moves
- Only shows **available** vehicles (not busy or offline)

### 6. **Vehicle Selection Integration**
On **VehicleSelectionScreen**:
- Map shows only the selected vehicle type
- Real-time count of nearby vehicles
- Updates instantly when switching vehicle types
- Example: Select "Auto" → map shows only nearby autos

## Technical Implementation

### Service Architecture

```typescript
// Initialize with mock vehicles
vehicleTrackingService.initializeMockVehicles(center, 20);

// Start real-time tracking
vehicleTrackingService.startTracking();

// Subscribe to updates
const unsubscribe = vehicleTrackingService.subscribe((vehicles) => {
  const nearby = vehicleTrackingService.getNearbyVehicles(
    lat, lng, 5, 'auto' // 5km radius, autos only
  );
  setNearbyVehicles(nearby);
});

// Cleanup
unsubscribe();
vehicleTrackingService.stopTracking();
```

### Map Component Updates

**New Props**:
- `nearbyVehicles?: Vehicle[]` - Array of tracked vehicles
- `vehicleType?: 'bike' | 'auto' | 'car'` - Filter by type

**3D Map Settings**:
```typescript
{
  tilt: 45,        // Enable 3D perspective
  heading: 0,      // Map rotation
  zoom: 14-15      // Optimal zoom for vehicle viewing
}
```

### Animation System

**Smooth Movement**:
- Uses `easeInOutQuad` easing function
- 30 animation frames over 2 seconds
- Marker positions interpolated smoothly
- No jittery movements

**Bearing Rotation**:
- SVG rotates based on vehicle heading (0-360°)
- Arrow points in direction of travel
- Updates every position change

## User Experience

### HomeScreen
1. **See live vehicles** moving on map
2. **Filter by type** using top buttons
3. **Live count** badges show available vehicles
4. **"Live Tracking"** badge confirms real-time updates
5. **Tap markers** to see driver details

### VehicleSelectionScreen
1. **Select vehicle type** (Bike/Auto/Car)
2. **Map updates** to show only that type
3. **See nearby count** in bottom badge
4. **Watch vehicles** move in real-time
5. **Choose and book** with confidence

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Updates**: Only re-renders when vehicles move
2. **Cleanup**: Proper subscription management prevents memory leaks
3. **Marker Reuse**: Updates existing markers instead of recreating
4. **Distance Filtering**: Only processes nearby vehicles (5km radius)
5. **Optimized Rendering**: Uses `optimized: false` only when needed

## Testing Scenarios

## Configuration

### Adjust Update Frequency
```typescript
// In vehicleTrackingService.ts
this.updateInterval = setInterval(() => {
  this.updateVehiclePositions();
  this.notifySubscribers();
}, 2000); // Change to 3000 for 3 seconds, etc.
```

### Adjust Vehicle Count
```typescript
// In HomeScreen.tsx
vehicleTrackingService.initializeMockVehicles(currentLocation, 20);
// Change 20 to desired number (10-50 recommended)
```

### Adjust Search Radius
```typescript
// In HomeScreen.tsx / VehicleSelectionScreen.tsx
vehicleTrackingService.getNearbyVehicles(lat, lng, 5, type);
// Change 5 to desired radius in km (2-10 recommended)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Vehicles not moving
- **Check**: `vehicleTrackingService.startTracking()` is called
- **Check**: Component has active subscription
- **Check**: Console for errors

### Too many/few vehicles
- Adjust `initializeMockVehicles(center, count)` parameter
- Check distance radius in `getNearbyVehicles()`

### Markers not showing
- Verify Google Maps API key is set
- Check browser console for API errors
- Ensure `nearbyVehicles` prop is passed to MapComponent

### Laggy animations
- Reduce vehicle count (try 10-15 instead of 20)
- Increase update interval (3000ms instead of 2000ms)
- Check browser performance

## Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
