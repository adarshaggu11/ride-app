## 🎯 Next Steps (To Launch)

### Step 1: Get API Keys (30 minutes)

1. **Google Maps API** (Required)
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Create a new project
   - Enable these APIs:
     - Maps JavaScript API
     - Places API
     - Directions API
     - Geocoding API
   - Create credentials → API Key
   - Copy your API key

2. **Razorpay** (For Payments)
   - Go to: https://dashboard.razorpay.com/
   - Sign up and verify business
   - Get API keys from Settings → API Keys

3. **Twilio** (For SMS)
   - Go to: https://www.twilio.com/
   - Sign up for account
   - Get Account SID and Auth Token

### Step 2: Configure Environment (5 minutes)

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
# Use any text editor (notepad, VS Code, etc.)
```

Add these keys to `.env`:
```env
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_key_here
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_here
VITE_SMS_API_KEY=your_twilio_key_here
```

### Step 3: Test the App (5 minutes)

The dev server is already running at: http://localhost:8080

1. Open the URL in your browser
2. You'll see the Splash Screen
3. Navigate through the onboarding screens
4. Test the home screen with location inputs
5. Try voice commands (click mic button if added to UI)

### Step 4: Build Backend (2-3 weeks)

**Required APIs** (see API_DOCUMENTATION.md for complete specs):

1. **Authentication**
   - POST /auth/register
   - POST /auth/verify-otp

2. **Rides**
   - POST /rides/request
   - GET /rides/{rideId}
   - POST /rides/{rideId}/cancel

3. **Payments**
   - POST /payments/initiate
   - POST /payments/verify

4. **Real-time** (WebSocket)
   - Driver location updates
   - Chat messages
   - Ride status updates

**Recommended Tech Stack:**
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express/Fastify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for relational data)
- **Cache**: Redis (for sessions, real-time data)
- **WebSocket**: Socket.io
- **Hosting**: AWS/Google Cloud/Azure

### Step 5: Deploy (1 week)

1. **Frontend Deployment**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Deploy dist/ folder to:
   # - Vercel (easiest)
   # - Netlify
   # - AWS S3 + CloudFront
   # - Your own server with Nginx
   ```

2. **Backend Deployment**
   - Set up cloud server
   - Configure database
   - Set up Redis
   - Deploy backend code
   - Set up SSL certificate

3. **Mobile Apps** (Optional - PWA works great!)
   ```bash
   # Build for Android
   npx cap add android
   npx cap sync android
   npx cap open android

   # Build for iOS
   npx cap add ios
   npx cap sync ios
   npx cap open ios
   ```
